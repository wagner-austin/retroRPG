# File: pygame_tile_drawing.py
# version: 1.2 (refactored to remove layer_for_def_id usage in rendering)
#
# Summary:
#   Contains common tile-drawing logic for the pygame UI. Moved here from
#   the renderer to allow a cleaner separation of responsibilities.
#
# ChangeLog:
#   v1.1:  - Added `compose_fg_with_floor_bg` helper to remove repeated code.
#          - Updated `draw_single_tile` & `draw_player_on_top` to use helper.
#   v1.2:  - Now draws floor plus other layers from layer_manager.get_layers_in_draw_order().
#          - The old code referencing layer_for_def_id is commented out.
#
# Tags: pygame, ui, rendering
