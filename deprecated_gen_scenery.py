All scenery-related functions have been moved into separate files:
  - gen_rivers.py      (rivers)
  - gen_grass.py       (grass patches, BFS, semicircle grass, etc.)
  - gen_rocks.py       (rocks)
  - gen_trees.py       (trees)
  - gen_bridges.py     (bridging)
This file is kept only for reference and is now effectively empty.
